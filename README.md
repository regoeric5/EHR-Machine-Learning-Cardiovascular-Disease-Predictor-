## üéØ Project Overview

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) affects over 116 million Americans, with a death occurring every 33 seconds. Early detection is critical to reducing CVD mortality rates. This project implements a machine learning system that predicts cardiovascular disease using only routine clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHR), making it accessible for widespread clinical adoption.

Traditional cardiovascular disease prediction often relies on:
- Advanced biomarkers
- Medical imaging
- Specialized equipment

Our approach uses only tabular electronic health data from routine clinical observations, making CVD prediction more accessible and practical for real-world deployment. Importantly, all models were trained on a standard laptop without requiring specialized computing resources, GPU acceleration, or cloud infrastructure.

## üìä Dataset

**Source**: MIMIC-IV v3.1 (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)
- Real-world Electronic Health Records from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC)
- De-identified patient data from hospital admissions

### Data Requirements
Each observation included in the study required:
- Unique hospital admission ID (HADM_ID)
- At least one laboratory test result
- At least one valid heart rate reading
- At least one prescription record



### Features (49 Total)
- **Laboratory values** - Routine blood work and clinical tests
- **Vital signs** - Heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, etc.
- **Demographic information** - Age, gender, ethnicity
- **Comorbidity flags** - Pre-existing conditions and risk factors

### Classification Task

The model predicts the presence of four types of cardiovascular disease:
1. **Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)
2. Ischemic Stroke
3. Heart Failure
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

**Output Classification**:
- `1` - Patient has one or more of the CVD conditions
- `0` - Patient has none of the CVD conditions

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Feature Selection**
   - Excluded features with >30% null values
   - Maintained data quality while preserving sample size

2. **Missing Value Imputation**
   - Applied median imputation for remaining null values
   - Preserved statistical properties of the data

3. **Encoding**
   - Label encoding for categorical features
   - Converted all features to numeric representations

4. **Normalization**
   - Standard Scaler applied to all features
   - Ensured fair contribution across different measurement scales

5. **Train-Test Split**
   - 80% training data
   - 20% testing data

### Machine Learning Models

Six different models were implemented and evaluated:

1. **Logistic Regression Classifier** - Baseline linear model
2. **Random Forest Classifier** - Ensemble decision tree approach
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Non-linear classification with kernel methods
4. **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** - Advanced gradient boosting framework
5. **Voting Classifier** - Hard/soft voting ensemble
6. **Meta-Learner Stacking Ensemble** - Multi-layer ensemble architecture

### Hyperparameter Optimization

- Grid Search Cross-Validation
- Systematically explored hyperparameter space
- Optimization metrics: ROC AUC and F1-Score
- Applied to all models for fair comparison

## üìà Results

The models demonstrated strong predictive performance on routine clinical data:

## üè• Problem Statement

Traditional cardiovascular disease prediction often relies on:
- Advanced biomarkers
- Medical imaging
- Cholesterol readings
- Specialized equipment

This creates barriers to early detection in many healthcare settings. Our approach uses **only tabular electronic health data** from routine clinical observations, making CVD prediction more accessible and practical for real-world deployment.
